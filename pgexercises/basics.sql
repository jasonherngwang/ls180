-- 1. Retrieve everything from a table
SELECT *
  FROM cd.facilities;

-- 2. Retrieve specific columns from a table
SELECT name, membercost
  FROM cd.facilities
  
-- 3. Control which rows are retrieved
SELECT *
  FROM cd.facilities
 WHERE membercost > 0;
 
-- 4. Control which rows are retrieved - part 2
SELECT facid,
       name,
       membercost,
       monthlymaintenance
  FROM cd.facilities
 WHERE membercost > 0
   AND membercost < monthlymaintenance / 50.0;

-- 5. Basic string searches
SELECT *
  FROM cd.facilities
 WHERE name LIKE '%Tennis%';
-- WHERE name ~ '.*Tennis.*';
-- WHERE name SIMILAR TO '%Tennis%';

-- 6. Matching against multiple possible values
SELECT *
  FROM cd.facilities
 WHERE facid IN (1, 5);
 
-- 7. Classify results into buckets
SELECT name,
       CASE WHEN monthlymaintenance > 100
            THEN 'expensive'
            ELSE 'cheap'
       END AS cost
  FROM cd.facilities;
  
-- 8. Working with dates
SELECT memid,
       surname,
       firstname,
       joindate
  FROM cd.members
 WHERE joindate >= '2012-09-01';
-- WHERE joindate >= '2012-09-01 00:00:00';

-- 9. Removing duplicates, and ordering results
SELECT DISTINCT surname
  FROM cd.members
 ORDER BY surname
 LIMIT 10;
 
-- 10. Combining results from multiple queries
SELECT surname
  FROM cd.members
 UNION
SELECT name
  FROM cd.facilities;
  
-- 11. Simple aggregation
SELECT max(joindate) AS latest
  FROM cd.members;

-- 12. More aggregation
SELECT firstname,
       surname,
       joindate
  FROM cd.members
 WHERE joindate = (SELECT max(joindate)
                     FROM cd.members
                  );
